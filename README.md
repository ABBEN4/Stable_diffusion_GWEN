# Stable_diffusion_GWEN
A "human in the loop" workflow for Stable Diffusion comparable to the Midjourney experience


##. Source Colab

##. Modifications

- Setting up a userfriendly version of the file with colab froms as GUI
- Setting up a three step image generation process to select the prefered picture and propose variations based on random Stable Diffusion parameters
- Linking the whole process with Real-ESRGAN 

##. Why this modification

The workflow of Midjourney allows for randomness and paramers to generate alternatives to the prefered picture which can lead to serendipitiously generated pleasing productions.  So far this random slight variation part is not available (to my knowledge) in Stable diffusion and so I setup this to improve the workflow. Adding an implementation of Real-ESRGAN to complete the process.
